# Marching for Rays
This is a ray marcher demo I made in 2019. I was inspired after taking the Linear Algebra course at the university and wanted to try to implement a ray marcher with the knowledge I had in my head. And it kinda works! Yay! :) 

It's not at the least optimized, but it serves as a pretty decent proof of concept.

I also included some of the progress images showing the different results I got during the development process. 

## Progress images
My [first success](images/fÃ¶rsta.txt).. is the output of the console â€“ it was a really satisfying moment!

My second success was this image:

This is by no means a finished product, it's more like a fun work in progress. Teaching myself some graphics principals. ðŸ˜Ž
